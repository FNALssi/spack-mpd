# Spack MRB

Spack MRB is a Spack extension that allows users to develop CMake-based packages in concert with Spack-provided external software.

## Prerequisites

1. You must be able to write to the Spack installation that you set up.
    - _You are encouraged to [chain upstream Spack installations](https://spack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/chain.html) to your own installation to avoid unnecessary building, installation, and wasted disk space._
1. Each package to be developed must have a [Spack recipe](https://spack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/packaging_guide.html).
